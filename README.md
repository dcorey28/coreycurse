# Corey Curse Web Portal
A static web portal hosted at [coreycurse.com](http://coreycurse.com) to make it easier for the Corey family to connect and communicate.

### Implementation
The web portal is implemented using a light weight css framework [W3.CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp) and is hosted on an Amazon S3 bucket.

### Contributing
Feel free to contribute to the project. If you have an idea for how to make the portal even better you can submit a pull request or discuss your idea in the `#stackoverflow` channel on the Corey Curse Slack Group.

### ToDo:
* Secure portal with TLS
* Automate the deployment process so that when changes are merged into master the website is re-deployed to S3
* Add better tutorials or documentation to make Slack accessible for all members of the family
